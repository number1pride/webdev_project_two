    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Driven and passionate about creating maximum value to my customers, I strive to build long-term relationships
      focusing on a win-win approach. In addition, my purpose is to fully understand the customers' environment and
      goals so that I may identify the products and services that will maximize their success. As a Sr. Sales Engineer I
      work with various levels of telecommunication companies providing the latest technologies and enhancing them
      to produce a transformative communications and entertainment experience for their customer base. In the last
      20+ years, I have had the privilege of working for the largest companies in the industry in numerous roles includ-
      ing technical operations, engineering, leadership, and pre-sales efforts.</p>
